# QM handbook for mipt students (v 1.0)
Quantum mechanics has never been an easy subject to learn. When i was a student i used to struggle with finding a good handbook or lectures for solving problems and understanding new approaches. Thus, after several years of teaching students, I decided to create an "easy to read" handbook, which is supposed to help bachelor's students to develop a new mathematical approach and applied it to the new physics. Surely, it should also help them to pass QM exams :)

# QM handbook for mipt students (v 0.8)
Quantum mechanics has never been an easy subject to learn. When i was a student i struggled with finding a good handbook or lectures for solving problems and understand new approaches. Thus, after several years of educating students, I decide to create an "easy to read" handbook, which is supposed to help bachelor's students to develop an new mathematical approach and applied it to new physic. Surely, it should also help them to pass QM exams :)
